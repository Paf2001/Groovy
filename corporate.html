          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>To create a successful marketing campaign every brand should understand their target audience and focus on the consumer instead of the brand or product. The target audience for the brand and the marketing campaign is team hip-hop dancers, aged 20-28, who live in the Netherlands with no preferences about gender. They are outgoing people, dedicated to the art of hip-hop dancing and their teams. They focus on the dance routines and strive to be the best dancers and push towards perfection.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign of Groove aims to portray the brand on Instagram as a human instead of a corporate page, helps to connect to the target audience and create a relationship with them. This way we put the brand amongst them instead of observing from the side. What we mean with “humanizing” the brand is – using their language when creating the content and include ourselves with them by using” we” and “together”. Additionally, the content is created with the values of the company in mind and incorporated in the visuals and the text executed. </p>
			
<p>The big idea of the marketing campaign is Groove it up. When you throw on your favorite comfortable dancing clothes and go straight to dancing you can ignore the importance of proper stretching. Diving into the fun part can be tempting, that is why Groove is offering both – preventing injuries by grooving it up. 
Showcasing stretching in a fun and engaging way can encourage dancers to get educated on the topic and importance of it. Starting slow and steady when it comes to educating can help to keep the user engaged rather than just overwhelm them with dry information.</p> 
			
<p>For the purpose of this campaign we created a content calendar with detailed information about the all the content that needs to be executed. Including the posting date, the status (pending or posted), the caption, visual description and format. </p>

<h3>Message</h3>
<p>The message of the campaign is to show the importance of stretching, while making it fun, so it can blend seamlessly into the consumers dance training. 
</p>
			<h3>Promotional activities</h3>
<p>A promotional activity executed during this campaign is the hashtag #grooveitup, used on different content with call to action towards the viewers, so they can share their favorite routine/ritual before training. Since we as a brand are offering a platform that focuses on prevention of injuries, we suggest to the users to stretch before training. Keeping this in mind, we wanted to create engagement by prompting our viewers to share what are they currently doing before their training. The goal of this promotional activity is to first focus on the user and make it entirely about them, what are they doing and providing a platform for them to share more of themselves where they can be seen and heard. The second idea behind this activity is to introduce Groove as something that they can include in their ritual with the prompt to #groove it up. And third, by asking followers to share their experience related to the brand, the brand can gather organic engagement and get pushed to more people as possible interesting page as well as getting known by the current follower followers. </p>
			
<h3>Objectives</h3>
			<h4>Communication objective(s):</h4> 
<h5>Reach 100 views on Instagram reels by the end of March of 2024. </h5>
<p>Formulated in SMART way:</p> 
<p>•Specific: Reach 100 views on Instagram reels by the end of March of 2024.</p> 
<p>•Measurable: Use Instagram analytics to keep track of the views on the reels.</p>

<p> •Specific: Increase the brand Instagram followers to 100 followers by the end of March of 2024.</p> 
<p> •Measurable: Usage of Instagram analytics to keep track of the growth of the followers.</p>

<p> •Time-bound: Achieve the set objectives within the set period of one month, by doing a regular evaluation (1 week) and adjust the strategy to optimize performance and reach. </p>  
 

<h5>Platform used</h5>

After conducting our interviews with participants of the target audience we collected the information that they mainly use Instagram. They use the platform to connect with their peers, to watch hip-hop related media. Additionally, we researched about the Instagram usage in the Netherlands. According to Statista (2024), the biggest group in the Netherlands who uses the platform is females between 25-34 years old. Since the biggest user group in the NL is part of our target audience, we decided to use the platform to execute our campaign. Additionally, the platform offers different easy to use formats of content that can be used to reach the target audience organically. 

          
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During the duration of this marketing campaign we learned a lot more about the Instagram algorithm and how it can help a brand or prevent it from reaching their target audience. We learned that the platform values original content, the users prefer more fast paced video format content. They can easily get bored and scroll away if the video does not catch their attention.</p> 

         <p>Based on the engagement of the post from the professional dashboard of the platform we learned that it is easier to reach new accounts through reels (video format) while the other forms are more suitable for engaging current followers. </p>

          <p>Additionally, carousels are better for the engagement of the Instagram profile, since the user can stop on the post, review it slide to the next picture, therefore is spending more on the post which indicates to the algorithm that this post is interesting, and it is promoting it to other users with similar interests.</p>
		
			<h5>What worked and what didn’t?</h5>

<p>What worked is the reach that we got for the reels on Instagram. Our goal was to reach at least 100 views on a reel and as of April 2, the most viewed reel on the profile reached 515 views and reached 380 accounts on the platform. All of the reels exceeded the goal, by having more than 100 views each. Additionally, for the duration of the campaign the audience reached was more than 750 profiles. 
What did not work was to turn this audience into active followers. Our approach worked to break through the algorithm and get shown to more people outside of the follower list, however they did not take the extra step to follow the account. Therefore, we are little below our second objective, which was to reach 100 followers, with 67 total followers as of April 2nd. </p>

<h5>What went as expected and what didn’t?</h5>

<p>What went as expected is the exact posting dates with the content planned. We initially agreed to post 3 times per week to be able to evaluate the campaign properly at the end of March with consistent flow of posting. We did not expect to exceed the target of the reach for the reels, which was a pleasant outcome of the campaign. What we did not expect was how hard it is to turn viewers into followers. However, we understand that in order to gain live audience that will continue to engage with posts from the brand is better to slowly grow the account instead of having viral post that will create an audience for a moment that will not be sustained in the future. </p>


<h5>What would you do differently?</h5>

<p>If we were planning the campaign from the beginning with the knowledge we have now, we would have preferred to post more than 3 times per week as a new brand on the market, so we can set ourselves as a name on social media. Incorporate content with talking instead of only visuals and music. This can help connecting to target audience in more personal level. Additionally, we would use another platform alongside Instagram to gather more engagement on different platforms.</p> 

			<h5>Comparing to the Communication and Media Plan;</h5>

<p>•	The content calendar went through changes. The main ideas were kept however the captions and the visual descriptions were fluid which at the same time gave freedom with experimenting with the visuals, however, created a bit of a hassle when creating the content itself and increased the workload.</p>
<p>•	We reached our views reach for the reels, however the viewers did not turn to followers. We wanted 100 followers, however we reached almost 70 followers, which is not so far from the initial goal.</p>
<p>•	One of the reels reached 515 views, reached total of 380 accounts, gathered 20 likes, 3 comments and 1 save. This shows us that we can reach even higher when it comes to Reel engagement and views and Instagram is the right platform to use for this format of content to reach the target audience.</p>

			
			
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>To be able to reach our initial goal for the Instagram page and continue growing there are a few steps to follow.</p>
<p>First, the content calendar should be planned for 5 days instead of 3 how it is currently. This way we increase the chance of exposure to potential users. During the project external tools were used to determine the usability of the hashtags in the posts – which are the most used ones, and which brought more viewers to the post. This should continue to be monitored and used to reach better results.</p>
<p>Additionally, another platform will be added. Since according to the engagement information from the Instagram’s dashboard the video format was the most successful this can be used in another platform. Tik Tok is another platform that is used within the target audience and uses video format content. This can help us reach our target audience through another channel and since it already uses the video content – the content can be reused between the two platforms.</p>
<p>When it comes to the content, all material should be prepared for the following week. Currently the posts were planned, however they were visualized shortly before posting. This can be stressful and lead to mistakes. Therefore, it would work better if every week the content is prepared for the next, discussed within the group and feedback should be applied. This can ensure quality content that engages the viewers and turn them into followers. </p>
