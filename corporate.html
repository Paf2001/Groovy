                  <em>is bright and energetic: Orange is associated with optimism, confidence, enthusiasm, playfulness and agreeableness. Because it is a bright and vivacious colour, it may help people feel outgoing or even bold. It is invigorating and evokes energy.  &hellip;</em>

                 <p> <em>This shades of grey are associated with balance, stability, and neutrality. They convey a sense of reliability and professionalism. French Gray suggests refinement and classic taste, making it suitable for our brand that is aiming for a vintage image, similar to our name “Groove” . But simultaneously the soft hue of the Isabelline evokes feelings of cleanliness and clarity, making it ideal for also maintaining a somewhat modern look. What is more, the Moonstone Turquoise combines the calming properties of blue with the invigorating aspects of green, highlighting a balance between relaxation and vitality. This balance mirrors the holistic approach to physical health and well-being promoted by our platform, where stretching is integrated seamlessly into the energetic atmosphere of hip-hop dance &hellip;</em></p>

            </li>
			  
			  
           <li><p>Fonts: Rustica extra bold and Effra CC Black: </p>
<p>Rustica Extra Bold stands out with its bold strokes and distinctiveness, embodying unity and self-expression within the community, in the context of a platform tailored to the needs and wants of hip- hop dancers this font blends perfectly with the preferences of artistic and bold young people. Meanwhile, Effra CC Black contributes to this ethos with its bold appearance and modern style, promoting confidence, inclusivity and fostering a dynamic environment suitable for both learning and self-expression, resonating with the rhythm and energy of hip-hop dance.</p>  </li>

				  <h5>User Interface Elements:</h5>

<p>Implementing a simple grid layout on the homepage helps organize content effectively, allowing for clear navigation and visual hierarchy. Such grids enable the presentation of diverse content types, such as featured articles, video tutorials, and upcoming events in a more organised way. It is also designed with a colour palette that matches recent trend choices among the Gen. Z hip- hop dancer community.</p> 

<p>Carousel: </p>
				  <p>Incorporating a carousel feature for showcasing featured content enhances user engagement and interaction. It enables the platform to showcase actual dancers of the community, their stories, capturing users' attention and encouraging exploration, this content is perceived as both inspirational and educating, which is connected to our values- education and support. This element contributes to a similar layout as Instagram and therefore to a more intuitive UI design since the most used social media platform by our target audience is Instagram. The visuals also showcase the unique value preposition of our brand: Fostering a sense of belonging within the hip-hop community around the underestimated habit of stretching. </p> 

 

<p>Navigation bar:</p> 
				  <p>Organizing the menu with clear and intuitive labels enhances navigation efficiency. Categories such as "Home", "Services" or "About us" cater to the specific needs of users when they first enter the page, enabling seamless navigation and exploration of the platform's offerings. This user-centric approach facilitates easy access to relevant content and is also similar to social media platforms, as a result the simplicity of the bar lets the users focus on the content of the platform itself rather than overwhelming from the navigation. </p>

<p>Homepage Content Distribution:</p> 
	<p>Content units on the homepage are distributed strategically to provide a balanced overview of the platform's offerings as well as keep the user’s attention through visuals and short copies. This includes featuring recent events, and informative as well as motivating text paragraphs. The layout aims to capture users' interest immediately and encourages further exploration as well as to make the user feels like they are already part of the collaborative community of “Groove” (one of our values) in a way that is similar to the communication strategy of our brand.</p> </li>

            <p>A testing protocol has been conducted with the high-fidelity prototype. The team asked people from the target audience- hip- hop dancers in their 20s who live in the Netherlands a couple of questions regarding their user experience navigating the platform. </p> 

<p>The people were asked whether they recognise what the main objective of the website is, they were asked to navigate through the home page and to look for the services the brand provides as well as to read and think aloud if the information is clear and understandable for them.</p>  

<p>From the conducted interviews it has been concluded that the users get a clear idea of the main concept behind “Groove” within the first seconds of navigating through the home page. All of them were able to visit the “About us” page, to return to the “Home page” as well as to go through the services provided on the website. The majority of the testing users mentioned they didn’t have any problems with the website, what is more they enjoyed to colour palette as well as the supporting visuals, which help get a clearer idea of what the community of “Groove” is.  However, some of them pointed out that there are improvements to be made. Although they are not fatal for the UX they are still valid for the overall navigation.  The most crucial point of improvement would be to use more animations, so they are more stimulating for the users, nowadays many websites use more immersive graphics in order to keep the users in the platform for a longer time. Some of the testing users realised there isn’t any option for the free services the platform provides.  Another point that would contribute to the user experience is to incorporate a “Back button”, this would be very beneficial for the intuitive navigation of the user and could prevent many negative associations the users tend to have when they come across an obstacle. Finally, one of the participants mentioned he finds it difficult to read one of the values since it is in dark blue colour, so the dark bold text located in the blue bubble isn’t easy to read. Some more findings based on thorough reflection of the team were that the fonts on the website are logically connected to brand, its values and its target group, however due to the bold letters they are not easily readable and as a result contribute to a not fully effective comprehension of the text.  </p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>To create a successful marketing campaign every brand should understand their target audience and focus on the consumer instead of the brand or product. The target audience for the brand and the marketing campaign is team hip-hop dancers, aged 20-28, who live in the Netherlands with no preferences about gender. They are outgoing people, dedicated to the art of hip-hop dancing and their teams. They focus on the dance routines and strive to be the best dancers and push towards perfection.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign of Groove aims to portray the brand on Instagram as a human instead of a corporate page, helps to connect to the target audience and create a relationship with them. This way we put the brand amongst them instead of observing from the side. What we mean with “humanizing” the brand is – using their language when creating the content and include ourselves with them by using” we” and “together”. Additionally, the content is created with the values of the company in mind and incorporated in the visuals and the text executed. </p>
			
<p>The big idea of the marketing campaign is Groove it up. When you throw on your favorite comfortable dancing clothes and go straight to dancing you can ignore the importance of proper stretching. Diving into the fun part can be tempting, that is why Groove is offering both – preventing injuries by grooving it up. 
Showcasing stretching in a fun and engaging way can encourage dancers to get educated on the topic and importance of it. Starting slow and steady when it comes to educating can help to keep the user engaged rather than just overwhelm them with dry information.</p> 
			
<p>For the purpose of this campaign we created a content calendar with detailed information about the all the content that needs to be executed. Including the posting date, the status (pending or posted), the caption, visual description and format. </p>

<h3>Message</h3>
<p>The message of the campaign is to show the importance of stretching, while making it fun, so it can blend seamlessly into the consumers dance training. 
</p>
			<h3>Promotional activities</h3>
          <p>A promotional activity executed during this campaign is the hashtag #grooveitup, used on different content with call to action towards the viewers, so they can share their favorite routine/ritual before training. Since we as a brand are offering a platform that focuses on prevention of injuries, we suggest to the users to stretch before training. Keeping this in mind, we wanted to create engagement by prompting our viewers to share what are they currently doing before their training. The goal of this promotional activity is to first focus on the user and make it entirely about them, what are they doing and providing a platform for them to share more of themselves where they can be seen and heard. The second idea behind this activity is to introduce Groove as something that they can include in their ritual with the prompt to #groove it up. And third, by asking followers to share their experience related to the brand, the brand can gather organic engagement and get pushed to more people as possible interesting page as well as getting known by the current follower followers. </p>

<h5>Platform used</h5>

After conducting our interviews with participants of the target audience we collected the information that they mainly use Instagram. They use the platform to connect with their peers, to watch hip-hop related media. Additionally, we researched about the Instagram usage in the Netherlands. According to Statista (2024), the biggest group in the Netherlands who uses the platform is females between 25-34 years old. Since the biggest user group in the NL is part of our target audience, we decided to use the platform to execute our campaign. Additionally, the platform offers different easy to use formats of content that can be used to reach the target audience organically. 

          
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During the duration of this marketing campaign we learned a lot more about the Instagram algorithm and how it can help a brand or prevent it from reaching their target audience. We learned that the platform values original content, the users prefer more fast paced video format content. They can easily get bored and scroll away if the video does not catch their attention.</p> 

         <p>Based on the engagement of the post from the professional dashboard of the platform we learned that it is easier to reach new accounts through reels (video format) while the other forms are more suitable for engaging current followers. </p>

          <p>Additionally, carousels are better for the engagement of the Instagram profile, since the user can stop on the post, review it slide to the next picture, therefore is spending more on the post which indicates to the algorithm that this post is interesting, and it is promoting it to other users with similar interests.</p>
		
			<h5>What worked and what didn’t?</h5>

<p>What worked is the reach that we got for the reels on Instagram. Our goal was to reach at least 100 views on a reel and as of April 2, the most viewed reel on the profile reached 515 views and reached 380 accounts on the platform. All of the reels exceeded the goal, by having more than 100 views each. Additionally, for the duration of the campaign the audience reached was more than 750 profiles. 
What did not work was to turn this audience into active followers. Our approach worked to break through the algorithm and get shown to more people outside of the follower list, however they did not take the extra step to follow the account. Therefore, we are little below our second objective, which was to reach 100 followers, with 67 total followers as of April 2nd. </p>
<p>What did not work is the response rate of the #grooveitup, we were sharing it as a story format in our profile, but the users did not take the extra step to answer us.</p>

<h5>What went as expected and what didn’t?</h5>

<p>What went as expected is the exact posting dates with the content planned. We initially agreed to post 3 times per week to be able to evaluate the campaign properly at the end of March with consistent flow of posting. We did not expect to exceed the target of the reach for the reels, which was a pleasant outcome of the campaign. What we did not expect was how hard it is to turn viewers into followers. However, we understand that in order to gain live audience that will continue to engage with posts from the brand is better to slowly grow the account instead of having viral post that will create an audience for a moment that will not be sustained in the future. </p>


<h5>What would you do differently?</h5>

<p>If we were planning the campaign from the beginning with the knowledge we have now, we would have preferred to post more than 3 times per week as a new brand on the market, so we can set ourselves as a name on social media. Incorporate content with talking instead of only visuals and music. This can help connecting to target audience in more personal level. Additionally, we would use another platform alongside Instagram to gather more engagement on different platforms.</p> 

			<h5>Comparing to the Communication and Media Plan;</h5>

<p>•	The content calendar went through changes. The main ideas were kept however the captions and the visual descriptions were fluid which at the same time gave freedom with experimenting with the visuals, however, created a bit of a hassle when creating the content itself and increased the workload.</p>
<p>•	We reached our views reach for the reels, however the viewers did not turn to followers. We wanted 100 followers, however we reached almost 70 followers, which is not so far from the initial goal.</p>
<p>•	One of the reels reached 515 views, reached total of 380 accounts, gathered 20 likes, 3 comments and 1 save. This shows us that we can reach even higher when it comes to Reel engagement and views and Instagram is the right platform to use for this format of content to reach the target audience.</p>

			
			
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>To be able to reach our initial goal for the Instagram page and continue growing there are a few steps to follow.</p>
<p>First, the content calendar should be planned for 5 days instead of 3 how it is currently. This way we increase the chance of exposure to potential users. During the project external tools were used to determine the usability of the hashtags in the posts – which are the most used ones, and which brought more viewers to the post. This should continue to be monitored and used to reach better results.</p>
<p>Additionally, another platform will be added. Since according to the engagement information from the Instagram’s dashboard the video format was the most successful this can be used in another platform. Tik Tok is another platform that is used within the target audience and uses video format content. This can help us reach our target audience through another channel and since it already uses the video content – the content can be reused between the two platforms.</p>
<p>When it comes to the content, all material should be prepared for the following week. Currently the posts were planned, however they were visualized shortly before posting. This can be stressful and lead to mistakes. Therefore, it would work better if every week the content is prepared for the next, discussed within the group and feedback should be applied. This can ensure quality content that engages the viewers and turn them into followers. </p>
<p>Another thing that we should do in regards to the #grooveitup promotional activity is to make it clearer what they should do, how to add their answer so we can reach it and offer something in return so they can be more encouraged to share their experience with us.</p>

The post was created to slowly introduce what the brand is about. It shows the fascination of the brands creators to the target audience, shows their care towards them. This post is made in a video format to be able to reach more people with fast paced visuals. The text is placed in the description written in a engaging way connecting to the target audience rather than just sharing information for the brand. </p>

The brand logo is positioned on a wall in a graffiti style, using one of the main colors of the brand to create visual connection to the brand. Graffiti is something often connected with the target audience that is why the logo is put in a way "amongst" the audience. The caption is hinting more about the brands product without giving away all of the information, keeping the viewer intrigued.

After introducing the brand, itself, we focused on one of the brands values - education, by creating informative video, leading the viewer in the description to learn more. The video is showing a hard technique that requires a lot of physical strength and movement. The information is about one different type of stretching that can be used before training.</p>

A carousel with 4 photos containing informative text on each of them. The main photo of the carousel is attention grabber myth that is going around for a long time connected with knee pain, creating this attention grabber as a question towards the target audience allows to grab the attention without misinformation. The next information is about common injurie that happens amongst other in the target audience followed by a way to prevent that of happening to the viewer of the post. By keeping the text on the images, themselves we encourage the user to scroll and spend time on our post "marking" it as engaging therefore the algorithm of the platform can push it to other people who might be interested.

          <h5 class="fw-bold">Problem:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>After conducting the problem interviews and summarizing the main findings, the main problems that were discovered in the target audience of hip-hop group dancers were the following: </p>

<li>Lack of proper education about stretching:</li>  

<li> Sustain a lot of preventable injuries due to poor warm-ups: </li> 

<li> Suffer injuries that can lead to quitting dancing: </li> 

<li> Fear of letting the team down:  </li> 

<li> Minimal to no stretching before training:</li>  
            
          </ul>
			
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Solution:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>Based on the insights provided and the problems that were encountered, the solution we have is to ensure that dancers continue to practice what they love the most – dancing by educating them on the proper way of stretching. The solution is to create an online platform that offers educational videos about stretching and can connect our target audience with other dancers by sharing common experiences and exchanging knowledge. The main benefits of this platform are:  </p>

<li>Providing stretching exercises in the form of dance choreographies that make warming-up more entertaining and immersive. </li>

<li>Helping dancers integrate stretching in their dance routines.</li> 

<li>Providing an opportunity for young people to learn more about their bodies and their physical health (injuries). </li>

<li>Connecting dancers with like-minded people and helping them exchange ideas, experiences and knowledge.  </li>
          </ul>
			
			
			
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Customer segments:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>Our main target audience are both males and females in the Netherlands, in the ages of 20 to 28. Our target audience is Gen-Z, with some distinct characteristics like being socially responsible and embracing authenticity.  Research also suggests that Gen-Z cares more about brands that support values such as mental health. Based on our interviews and research, it is also evident that our target audience has a big social media presence. They mainly use Instagram and TikTok. When it comes to how our target audience finds products, research suggests that influencer marketing plays a big role when it comes to our target audience discovering new brands. Additionally, Instagram and TikTok are the go-to platforms for finding new products. </p> 
          </ul>
			
			
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>We help dancers prevent injuries by educating them how to incorporate proper stretching routine in the form of a unique and fun choreography, while also connecting them with fellow dancers and fostering a sense of belonging and understanding. </p> 

            <p>Our unique value proposition focuses on the most prevalent thing within the dance community – injuries and their prevention. With the way we have formulated our proposition, we are hoping to highlight the most valuable aspect of our brand, which is prevention and protection.</p>
			  <p>Value Proposition Canvas:</p>
			  
		    <img alt="finalleancanvas" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/valuepropositioncanvas/valuepropositioncanvas.png">
          </ul>
			
			
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>Our first unfair advantage is the alternative approach we have to a conventioanl old way of stretching.  We believe that stretching should be fun and should not be seen as a boring task, that is why we are turning stretching into a dance choreography, incorporating both educational and fun elements. Another advantage that sets us apart from competitors is the connection we have with our customers. We thrive to stay constantly in touch with our users and ensure that each stretching video on our platform matches their requirements and it is beneficial for their health. Another advantage of our brand is the accessibility we provide for our customers. Each user gets a 30-day free trial where they can experience most of our products, because we put our customer's health before any monetary gain. </p>
          </ul>
			
			
			
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Channels:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>The main path to our customers is through the social media platform we use – Instagram and through our website. The reason we chose Instagram as our channel for communication was because of the big usage from our target audience as mentioned before. Our main channel for distribution will be the website we create. Everything is online based, which eliminates the need for third parties for distribution and saves money on production costs. </p>
           
          </ul>
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Key metrics:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>The main key metrics that will be measured are: 

 

<li>Subscribers to social media account – This is the first key metric that will be measured. The only social media account we are using is Instagram. It is an indicator of our brand's presence, but also how popular and well-recognized our brand is within our target audience. This metric can be measured directly through Instagram analytics.</li>  

 

<li>Subscriptions to our platform - The second key metric is the number of subscriptions to the website. This is an important metric to measure since it will give us an idea of how well we are performing. The website is connected to Google analytics that can provide us with an insight of how many subscribers we get.</li>  

 

<li>Retention rate – The third important key metric is the retention rate. It provides information on the percentage of users who will continue to use the platform at any given moment, in our case after the trial period ends. This key metric is not only valuable because it shows us how popular the product is, but it also shows how loyal our customers are. The key metric can be measured through the number of users. (Franklin, 2023)</li>  </p>
          </ul>
            
          
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Revenue streams:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>The revenue model that our brand will be using is the Subscription Revenue Model. We chose this model since it can provide our customers with access to a vast library of educational content that is otherwise unavailable. Moreover, this model generates recurring revenue which can be beneficial for a start-up brand. This revenue model focuses on customer retention since the main revenue comes from recurring payments from customers. This also ties with one of the main key metrics that we are measuring – retention rate.</p>  
			<p>The subscription revenue model for Groove offers a 30-day free trial where the customers can experience the platform and the services offered. After that the subscription price is €6.99 per month.</p> 
			
			  <p>The revenue stream will be calculated as follows: </p>

 

<li>We consider the percentage of users who will subscribe to our platform. In this case we assume it will be 50%. We also consider the number of users who will sign up for our free trial. We assume this would be 5000 users for our first year.</li>  

 

<li>50% of 5000 users = 2500 active users (people who will stay subscribed to our platform)</li> 

 

<li>The price of the platform is €6.99 multiplied by 12 months = €83.88 for each user. </li>

 

<li>The total revenue will be 2500* €83.88 = 209 700</li> 

 

<li>Pricing – The price for a subscription is €6.99. It provides access to all content on the website, while the free plan offers access to a chosen selection of the content. Users have the chance of 30 days (about a month) of free trial to experience the platform.</li>  
          </ul>
			
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Cost structure:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>The costs are defined by the product we provide. Since we are offering an online stretching platform the following costs were considered:</p>
			  <h5>Fixed costs:</h5>
			  <li>Instructors for stretching/Yoga Instructors – average salary is €46 911.</li>
			  <li>Office rent - €259 a month = €3 108 a year </li>
			  <li>Filming equipment: 

<p>Camera  - €4 355.10</p> 

<p>Microphone - €529</p> 

<p>Wireless microphones - €299</p> 

<p>Led lights kit - €749</p> 

<p>Film studio rent - €1470 per week; Filming of content every three months (12 weeks) = €1470 * 12 weeks (about 3 months) = €17 640</p> </li>
			  
			  <li>Since filming of content takes place every 3 months, the annual costs for the filming studio are calculated as follows: total studio rent per session * number of sessions per year = €17 640 * (12 months/3 months) = €70 560 Total fixed costs: €159 658.1 </li>
			  
			  <p></p>
			  
			  <h5>Variable costs:</h5>  

<li>Commissions – Promoting the platform in the future with the use of influencer marketing could be beneficial for the growth of the business. Depending on the followers, the engagement rate, talent requirements, their rates and commissions can be different. A standard commission is in the range of 10-20%.</li>  
<li>The revenue is €20 970 and assuming an average commission of 15% = €3145.50 </li> 
<li>Total variable costs: €3145.50 </li>
<li>Total costs = total fixed costs + total variable costs = €159 658.1 + €3145.50= €162 803.6 </li>
<li>Cost per unit = total costs/ number of units produced</li>  

<p>In our case since we are creating a subscription-based platform we need to consider the subscribers of the platform, so the calculation will look as follows: </p>
<li>Cost per unit = total costs/ subscribers (we assume the active subscribers are 750)</li> 
<li>Cost per unit = 162 803.6/ 2500 </li>
<li>Cost per unit = €65.12</li> 
			  
          </ul>
			
			
			
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Services/products:</h5>
          <ul>
            <p>The main service our platform provides is stretching videos for dancers. The product is the videos itself. Additionally, users can access a forum section where they can share their thoughts, knowledge and experiences with other people. We aim to provide those services by motivating and educating dancers. The main reason we chose this idea for our platform was the recurring problem we have encountered within the dance community – injuries due to lack of proper stretching. Dancers often will skip stretching because it is not as engaging as dancing or because they are not aware of how important it is to warm your muscles. That is why we want to create videos that are interesting and unique enough for our users to keep watching. The stretching videos are curated in such a way that they are made like dance choreographies with different levels of intensity, so it can fit everyone's needs.</p>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions:</h4>
          <p>Based on the research we’ve conducted we assumed that dancers could be struggling with some sort of injuries or body image. Based on this, we’ve conducted our problem interviews and the assumption was validated. </p> 

<p>Additionally, we were able to narrow down the problem to a specific one - injuries obtained because of improper stretching which helped us further develop the brand identity. As for our target audience, we made some general assumptions like sex, age etc. We wanted to focus primarily on Gen-Z so our assumption was they will be our target audience. Furthermore, we assumed what social media platform they’ll be using based on research and our own usage. They were primarily using Instagram and TikTok. After finalizing the interviews, most assumptions were correct.</p> 

<p>Those problems currently could be solved with similar wellness platforms. For example, the website Pvolve has an interesting approach to customers, since they offer online wellness/fitness exercises with a purchase of equipment. Customers can purchase fitness equipment and get access to a 7-day free trial of the virtual classes offered by the company. They can also purchase two bundles - “The Signature” priced at $180 (customers receive 3 pieces of equipment and 1 month of streaming access) and the “Total Transformation” priced at $562.50(customers receive 13 pieces of equipment and 12 months of streaming access).</p>  

<p>Another way the problems are solved currently is by existing blogs where knowledgeable people can write articles about wellness and stretching, and others can use those posts for improvement.</p>  

<p>Stretching apps is also another way the problems are currently resolved. People can download those apps on their phone and have access to stretching videos everywhere.</p> 

<p>A main issue with all those options, however, is that often those stretches are not curated for the needs of dancers and can prevent users from doing exercises that fits their needs.</p>
